# dotfiles

This repository contains a collection of dot files that I use to configure my local work environment. The whole thing
is a continuous work-in-progress, and not intended to be shared.

## Installation

On a completely new system, the following should be installed manually:

* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
* Python and Pip
* [VirtualEnv Wrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#basic-installation)
* [Trash-CLI](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli)

Thereafter, the rest of the installation is automated by Anish Athalye's [DotBot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

```bash
    $> ./install.sh
```
